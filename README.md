# VanillaJSGame
- how to run
	- open `index.html` in your favorite browser

## why is this project special 
- as an idea it's simple but the inner implementation is with vanilla javascript (meaning no libraries are used),
and the code uses only functions that are available in all browser without any modifications
- the modules and linking between all the files is based on crockford's book 'Javascript the good parts'
